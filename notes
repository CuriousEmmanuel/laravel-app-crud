How I solved the error on migrating the tables due to unmatched database name 
first my laravel comes with sqlite as the mode of connection by default and I am using mysql 

so I had to manually change the mode of connection and the database name manuallly for bot the .env file and then go to the same project directory and change config/database.php 
you will notice the database name is still 'laravel' as default and the first thin on top is the mode of connection which for my case I am using a local database(xammp) so I need to change from sqlite to mysql
and the database name from laravel to your database name

  ####DATABASE ####

creating tables

tables in database with laravel you do not create directly on the database,
you generate them then migrate the table to the database with all columns

check the documentation on hoe to make the tables aand different column fields

eg. php artisan make:migration create_tablename_table




then open the database and go to migration 

you will see your table has been created 
open then input the columns you will need
if you want the column to contain string you can put string and the columnname

e.g. 
            //in documetation you will find all available column data types

            // $table-> datatype('column name');

            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->integer('qty');
            $table->decimal('price');
            $table->text('description');
            $table->timestamps();

id and timestampts is created by default so put other fields between then as by my knowledge
then input fields 

then after you have finished inputing the columns you create the table in your database by typing the command

php artisan migrate 

this command will generate the tables to you database
I have speculations that6 it can also update your existing tables but I am yet to find out

first create migation files then input the columns in the files then run php artisan migrate to generate thr table



#### MODEL ###

After creating tables now we need something to ineract with the database and query the the data from the database

in documentation go to eloquent then model then scroll down to #generating model classes

models provides a way to interact with the database in more object oriented way

Name the model relating to the table name
and it must be singular regardless if the table name is plural

  php artisan make:model modelname
 
 open app/models then your model
 starting to manage your table

 declare protected $fillable = [
 inside this array input the column name that we want users to input information into the database

  //make sure the collumns in $fillable match you columns in migration file
 ]
 eg.

     protected $fillable[
        'name',
        'qty',
        'price',
        'description'
    ]

    leave out the autogenerated one for now


    ####### controller #####

    next step is creating controller for your table in my case my product table
